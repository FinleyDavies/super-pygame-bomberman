if there is one component to movement:
    if distance to center > velocity:
        move forward by velocity
    if distance to center < velocity:
        move forward by distance to center
    if distance to center <= 0:
        [center, side]
        if 0,0:
            move forward by velocity
        if 0,1:
            if within corner thresh:
                move diagonally toward center
        if 1,1:
            don't move
        if 1,0:
            if in center of tile:
                face in control direction
            if facing perpendicular:
                move to center
